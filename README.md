The exercise problems for F# practice suggested by ChatGPT

#### Question
> I am trying F#. I just read the basic syntax. Then what is it good to do for me?

#### Answer from ChatGPT
> F# is a versatile language that can be employed in a variety of domains, thanks to its functional-first programming paradigm, strong static typing, and .NET framework integration. Here are some areas where F# can be particularly beneficial:
> 
> 1. Data Analysis and Science: F# can help you perform complex data transformations, statistical analyses, and visualization tasks. The language's strong typing and functional features make it easier to work with large datasets and implement complex algorithms.
> 2. Financial Applications: F# is a popular choice for quantitative finance and risk management applications. Its functional-first approach allows for more concise and expressive code, which is critical when working with financial models, pricing algorithms, and simulations.
> 3. Web Development: F# can be used for web development through libraries like Giraffe or Saturn, which are built on top of ASP.NET Core. These libraries allow you to create web applications using functional programming concepts, resulting in more maintainable and robust code.
> 4. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs): F# excels in creating internal and external DSLs, thanks to its concise syntax, pattern matching, and algebraic data types. You can create languages tailored to specific problem domains, making it easier to model and solve problems in those areas.
> 5. Concurrency and Parallelism: F#'s built-in support for asynchronous programming and parallelism allows you to create highly performant and scalable applications. The language's focus on immutability and functional programming can help you write more predictable and robust concurrent code.
> 6. Interoperability with .NET: Since F# is part of the .NET ecosystem, you can use it alongside other .NET languages such as C# and VB.NET. This means you can leverage existing .NET libraries, components, and tooling, as well as integrate F# code into existing .NET projects.

>As you continue learning F#, consider exploring these areas based on your interests and the problems you'd like to solve. The language's flexibility, expressiveness, and robustness make it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications.


## Problem 1. Fibonacci Sequence
### Subject 
Recursion, Tail Recursion

### Task
Write a function that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

$$F(0) = 0$$

$$F(1) = 1$$

$$F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\quad \sf for \it \quad  n > 1$$

Here's a template to get you started:
```F#
let rec fibonacci n =
    match n with
    | // Your code here

// Test your implementation
printfn "%d" (fibonacci 10) // Should print 55
```
To solve this problem, you'll need to use pattern matching to handle the base cases (```n = 0``` and ```n = 1```) and the recursive case (```n > 1```). When you've completed your implementation, test it with various input values to ensure it produces the correct Fibonacci numbers.

## Problem 2. Squares of Odd Numbers
### Subject
Higher-Order Functions, List Processing, Pattern Matching

### Task
Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the squares of the odd numbers in the input list.

Here's a template to get you started:

```F#
let squaresOfOdds numbers =
    // Your code here

// Test your implementation
let testNumbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9]
printfn "%A" (squaresOfOdds testNumbers) // Should print [1; 9; 25; 49; 81]
```
To solve this problem, consider using the ```List.filter``` and ```List.map``` functions. The ```List.filter``` function filters elements from a list based on a predicate (a function that returns ```true``` or ```false```), and the ```List.map``` function applies a given function to each element of a list and returns a new list with the transformed elements.

Additionally, you can use pattern matching to identify odd numbers. Once you've completed your implementation, test it with various input lists to ensure it produces the correct output.

## Problem 3. Palindrome Checker
### Subject
String Manipulation, Pattern Matching

### Task
Write a function called ```isPalindrome``` that takes a string as an argument and returns ```true``` if the input string is a palindrome, and ```false``` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## Problem 4. Group Elements
### Subject
List Processing, Recursion
### Task
Write a function called ```groupElements``` that takes a list of integers and an integer ```n``` as arguments, and returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains n elements from the input list. If the input list does not divide evenly by n, the last inner list should contain the remaining elements. Use list processing functions and recursion to implement this function.

## Problem 5. Person Type and Functions
### Subject
Record Types, Function Composition
### Task
Define a ```Person``` record type with properties ```FirstName```, ```LastName```, and ```Age```. Create the following functions:
 1. ```createPerson```: Takes a first name, last name, and age as arguments, and returns a new ```Person``` record.
 2. ```fullName```: Takes a ```Person``` record as an argument and returns a string containing the person's full name (i.e., first name and last name separated by a space).
 3. ```isAdult```: Takes a ```Person``` record as an argument and returns ```true``` if the person's age is 18 or older, and ```false``` otherwise.

## Problem 6. File I/O with Simple Text Database
### Subject
File I/O, List Processing
### Task
Create a simple program that reads and writes records (e.g., people's names and ages) from a text file. Implement the following functions:
 1. ```readRecords```: Takes a file name as an argument and returns a list of records read from the file.
 2. ```writeRecords```: Takes a file name and a list of records as arguments and writes the records to the file.
 3. ```addRecord```: Takes a list of records and a new record as arguments, and returns a new list with the new record added.

## Problem 7. CSV Average Calculator (upcoming)
### Subject
File I/O, CSV Processing
### Task
Create a function that reads a CSV file and calculates the average of numbers in a specified column.

## Problem 8. Contact List Manager (upcoming)
###Subject
Command-line interface, Data Manipulation
###Task
Create a command-line application that takes user input to perform various operations on a list of contacts (add, delete, search, etc.).

## Project Idea: Simple Command-Line Todo List Application (upcoming)
### Subject
Application Structure, File I/O, Command-Line Interface
### Task
Create a simple command-line todo list application that allows users to manage their tasks. The application should support the following operations:

 1. Add a new task.
 2. List all tasks.
 3. Mark a task as complete.
 4. Remove a task.
 5. Save tasks to a file.
 6. Load tasks from a file.

To implement this project, consider the following suggestions:

 1. Create a ```Task``` type to represent a task with properties such as ```Id```, ```Description```, and ```IsCompleted```.
 2. Use a list or other collection to store tasks in memory.
 3. Create functions to handle each operation (e.g., ```addTask```, ```listTasks```, ```markTaskComplete```, ```removeTask```, ```saveTasks```, and ```loadTasks```).
 4. Use pattern matching and/or if-then-else expressions to process user input and call the appropriate functions.
 5. Use F# file I/O functions to save and load tasks from a file (e.g., using ```System.IO.File``` methods).

## Problem 9. Find Prime Numbers (upcoming)
### Subject
Math and prime numbers
### Task
Implement a function that finds all prime numbers up to a given limit.
