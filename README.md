## Problem 1. Fibonacci Sequence
### Subject 
Recursion, Tail Recursion

### Task
Write a function that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

$$F(0) = 0$$

$$F(1) = 1$$

$$F\left(n\right) = \left(n-1\right) + F\left(n-2\right)\quad \mathsf{for}  \quad  n > 1$$

Here's a template to get you started:
```F#
let rec fibonacci n =
    match n with
    | // Your code here

// Test your implementation
printfn "%d" (fibonacci 10) // Should print 55
```
To solve this problem, you'll need to use pattern matching to handle the base cases (```n = 0``` and ```n = 1```) and the recursive case (```n > 1```). When you've completed your implementation, test it with various input values to ensure it produces the correct Fibonacci numbers.

### Rewiew
We should a technique called "tail recurssion", which is a form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function, to avoid stack overflow. 

## Problem 2. Squares of Odd Numbers
### Subject
Higher-Order Functions, List Processing, Pattern Matching

### Task
Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the squares of the odd numbers in the input list.

Here's a template to get you started:

```F#
let squaresOfOdds numbers =
    // Your code here

// Test your implementation
let testNumbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9]
printfn "%A" (squaresOfOdds testNumbers) // Should print [1; 9; 25; 49; 81]
```
To solve this problem, consider using the ```List.filter``` and ```List.map``` functions. The ```List.filter``` function filters elements from a list based on a predicate (a function that returns ```true``` or ```false```), and the ```List.map``` function applies a given function to each element of a list and returns a new list with the transformed elements.

Additionally, you can use pattern matching to identify odd numbers. Once you've completed your implementation, test it with various input lists to ensure it produces the correct output.

## Problem 3. Palindrome Checker
### Subject
String Manipulation, Pattern Matching

### Task
Write a function called ```isPalindrome``` that takes a string as an argument and returns ```true``` if the input string is a palindrome, and ```false``` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Write a function called isPalindrome that takes a string as an argument and returns true if the input string is a palindrome, and false otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Here's a template to get you started:

```F#
let isPalindrome (input: string) =
    // Your code here

// Test your implementation
printfn "%b" (isPalindrome "racecar") // Should print true
printfn "%b" (isPalindrome "hello") // Should print false
```
To solve this problem, consider using F#'s string manipulation functions to remove spaces, punctuation, and convert the string to lowercase. Then, you can compare the original cleaned string with its reverse. If they are the same, the input string is a palindrome. Once you've completed your implementation, test it with various input strings to ensure it produces the correct output.

## Problem 4. Group Elements
### Subject
List Processing, Recursion

### Task
Write a function called ```groupElements``` that takes a list of integers and an integer ```n``` as arguments, and returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains n elements from the input list. If the input list does not divide evenly by n, the last inner list should contain the remaining elements. Use list processing functions and recursion to implement this function.

Here's a template to get you started:

```F#
let rec groupElements lst n =
    // Your code here

// Test your implementation
let testList = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]
printfn "%A" (groupElements testList 3) // Should print [[1; 2; 3]; [4; 5; 6]; [7; 8; 9]; [10]]
```
To solve this problem, use pattern matching to handle the base case (an empty list) and the recursive case (a non-empty list). In the recursive case, create a new list with the first n elements of the input list, and concatenate this list with the result of calling ```groupElements``` on the remaining elements of the input list. Test your implementation with various input lists and group sizes to ensure it produces the correct output.

## Problem 5. Person Type and Functions
### Subject
Record Types, Function Composition

### Task
Define a ```Person``` record type with properties ```FirstName```, ```LastName```, and ```Age```. Create the following functions:
 1. ```createPerson```: Takes a first name, last name, and age as arguments, and returns a new ```Person``` record.
 2. ```fullName```: Takes a ```Person``` record as an argument and returns a string containing the person's full name (i.e., first name and last name separated by a space).
 3. ```isAdult```: Takes a ```Person``` record as an argument and returns ```true``` if the person's age is 18 or older, and ```false``` otherwise.

 Here's a template to get you started:

```F#
 type Person = {
    FirstName: string
    LastName: string
    Age: int
}

let createPerson firstName lastName age =
    // Your code hear

let fullName person =
    // Your code hear

let isAdult person =
    // Your code hear

// Test your implementation
let person = createPerson "John" "Doe" 25
printfn "Full name: %s" (fullName person)
printfn "Is adult: %b" (isAdult person)
```
This code defines a ```Person``` record type with ```FirstName```, ```LastName```, and ```Age``` properties. It also defines the ```createPerson```, ```fullName```, and ```isAdult``` functions. Finally, it tests the implementation with a sample person.

## Problem 6. File I/O with Simple Text Database
### Subject
File I/O, List Processing

### Task
Create a simple program that reads and writes records (e.g., people's names and ages) from a text file. Implement the following functions:
 1. ```readRecords```: Takes a file name as an argument and returns a list of records read from the file.
 2. ```writeRecords```: Takes a file name and a list of records as arguments and writes the records to the file.
 3. ```addRecord```: Takes a list of records and a new record as arguments, and returns a new list with the new record added.

## Problem 7. Reverse a List
### Subject
List processing and recursion

### Task
Implement a function that reverses a list using recursion. The function should take a list as input and return a new list with the elements in reverse order.

Here's a template to get you started:

```F#
let rec reverseList lst =
    match lst with
    | // Your code here

// Test your implementation
let testList = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
printfn "%A" (reverseList testList) // Should print [5; 4; 3; 2; 1]
```
To solve this problem, use pattern matching to handle the base case (an empty list) and the recursive case (a non-empty list). In the recursive case, you will need to append the head of the input list to the result of reversing the tail of the list. Test your implementation with various input lists to ensure it produces the correct output.

### Review
This function is ``List.rev`` in F# Core library.

## Problem 8. Flatten Nested Lists
### Subject
List processing and recursion

### Task
Implement a function that flattens a nested list structure. The function should take a nested list as input and return a new list containing all the elements from the input list, in the same order but without any nesting.

Here's a template to get you started:

```F#
let rec flatten lst =
    match lst with
    | // Your code here

// Test your implementation
let testNestedList = [[1; 2]; [3; 4; 5]; [6]; []; [7; 8; 9]]
printfn "%A" (flatten testNestedList) // Should print [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9]
```
To solve this problem, use pattern matching to handle the base case (an empty list) and the recursive case (a non-empty list). In the recursive case, you will need to concatenate the head of the input list (which is itself a list) with the result of flattening the tail of the input list. Test your implementation with various input lists to ensure it produces the correct output.

### Review
This function is ``List.collect`` in F# Core library.


## Problem 9. CSV Average Calculator (upcoming)
### Subject
File I/O, CSV Processing

### Task
Create a function that reads a CSV file and calculates the average of numbers in a specified column. Assume that the CSV file has a header row and the data rows contain only numbers. The CSV file could look like this:
```txt
A,B,C
1,2,3
4,5,6
7,8,9
```
Implement a function ```averageOfColumn``` that takes a file name and a column name as arguments, reads the CSV file, and calculates the average of the specified column. Use F#'s file I/O functions and string manipulation functions to process the CSV file. When you've completed your implementation, test it with various CSV files and column names to ensure it produces the correct output.

Here's a template to get you started:

```F#
let averageOfColumn fileName columnName =
    // Your code here

// Test your implementation
let testFileName = "test.csv"
let testColumnName = "B"
printfn "%.2f" (averageOfColumn testFileName testColumnName) // Should print 5.00
```
These problem statements and tasks should provide more guidance for completing the remaining problems.
## Problem 10. Contact List Manager (upcoming)
### Subject
Command-line interface, Data Manipulation
### Task
Create a command-line application that allows users to perform various operations on a list of contacts. The application should support the following operations:

 1. Add a new contact
 2. Delete a contact
 3. Search for a contact by name
 4. Update contact details
 5. List all contacts
 6. Save contacts to a file
 7. Load contacts from a file

To implement this project, consider the following suggestions:

 1. Create a ```Contact``` type to represent a contact with properties such as ```Id```, ```FirstName```, ```LastName```, ```Email```, and ```PhoneNumber```.
 2. Use a list or other collection to store contacts in memory.
 3. Create functions to handle each operation (e.g., ```addContact```, ```deleteContact```, ```searchContact```, ```updateContact```, ```listContacts```, ```saveContacts```, and ```loadContacts```).
 4. Use pattern matching and/or if-then-else expressions to process user input and call the appropriate functions.
 5. Use F# file I/O functions to save and load contacts from a file (e.g., using ```System.IO.File``` methods).

Your command-line application should be interactive and present a menu to the user. The menu should display the available operations and prompt the user for input. Based on the user's input, the application should perform the corresponding operation and display the result. The application should continue running until the user decides to exit.

Here's a rough outline of how your application might look:
```F#
type Contact = {
    Id: int
    FirstName: string
    LastName: string
    Email: string
    PhoneNumber: string
}

// Functions for contact management (addContact, deleteContact, searchContact, updateContact, listContacts, saveContacts, and loadContacts)

let rec mainLoop contacts =
    // Display the menu and prompt the user for input
    // Perform the selected operation
    // Update the contacts list if necessary
    // Call mainLoop with the updated contacts list

// Load contacts from a file (if available) and start the main loop
let initialContacts = loadContacts "contacts.txt"
mainLoop initialContacts
```

Make sure to test your implementation with various operations and scenarios to ensure it works correctly.
